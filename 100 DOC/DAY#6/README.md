## Summary

Today we enter the world of __*Data Structures*__. For the first program of Data Structures, we will be looking into the __*Double Ended Queue & Single Linked Lists*__ Data Structures. Later on, we will jump into other complex data structures and their algorithms too.

The codes are written in both __*C & Python*__. I would love for anyone interested to write and push the code into multiple other languages!

## List of Programs:

1. DEQueue - C
2. DEQueue - Python
3. Single Linked List - C
4. Single Linked List - Python
