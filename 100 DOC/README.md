# 100 days of code!

Welcome to my __first__ _\#100daysofcode_ challenge. 

## What are we gonna do?

As a wise man said:
>Either one day, or day one!

Enough of anxiety taken! It's time for some action.

## How?

I will be uploading atleast 2 __*Java*__ codes daily for a hundred days and hopefully _so on..._

However easy the problem might be or however hard! It is my task to upload the code here. 

### And this is a promise I will keep! (duh!)

I sincerely wish that whoever tumbles upon this repo, to add code in various languages to the programs I push here.
