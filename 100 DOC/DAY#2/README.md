## Summary

Today, we start an organized path to building ourselves a strong base in _programming languages_ starting with the basic __*C/C++*__. We look into various basic tools in the language like:
    -[x] Variables
    -[x] Data Types
    -[x] Operators
    -[x] Conditional Statements
    -[x] Loops

Even though day #1 went shooting off all of a sudden with Sorting methods and other intermediate concepts, I decided not to speedrun these 100 days and plan them accordingly for a comprehensive understanding.

These are implemented in __*C/C++*__, scripts in any other languages are encouraged!
