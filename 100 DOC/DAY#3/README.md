## Summary

Today, we go on our quest to ace programming by writing our first __*Object-Oriented Code.*__ We then move on to solving 6 problems which involve mathematics and logical thinking and not much of Data Structures and Algorithms, though we will be doing them from around day #15.

These programs are implemented in __*C/C++ & Java*__, scripts in any other languages are encouraged!
