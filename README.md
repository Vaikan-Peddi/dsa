# What's this?

This repo contains my tinkering with the __*C/Python/Java*__ programming languages and the *__Data Structures and Algorithms__* I have programmed using the _CLRS_ book as reference.

I started a ___100 Days of Code___. You can track it down in the [100 DOC folder](https://github.com/Vaikan-Peddi/java-dsa/tree/main/100%20DOC)! 


## I have failed

I have failed to complete my journey of 100 days of code. Even though I was coding something everyday, I was not able to push everyday. I wish to complete it in my next take of this remarkable journey.
