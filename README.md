# What's this?

This repo contains my tinkering with the __*Java*__ programming language and the *__Data Structures and Algorithms__* I have programmed using the _CLRS_ book as reference.

I started a ___100 Days of Code___. You can track it down in the [100 DOC folder](https://github.com/Vaikan-Peddi/java-dsa/tree/main/100%20DOC)!
